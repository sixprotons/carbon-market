## Carbon Market
The Carbon Market is a voluntary offset marketplace. Entities operating Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) instruments can gain virtual carbon credit for sale to interested parties seeking to offset carbon dioxide emissions.

The goal of the Carbon Market is to allow small, decentralized CDR entities pool their capture and sell the resulting credit in bundles, bringing value to a broad range of buyers.

### Workflows
Trapper uses a capture instrument to remove C02 from the atmosphere and trades the net removal for carbon credit Spender purchases carbon credit to secure cheap rates for the future and improve PR while operating ethically.

### Data
8.9 kg CO2/gal
ldv: average 25 mpg
[EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle-0)

ldv: average 15k miles/year
[DOE](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/data/10309)

15000 / 25 = 600 gal/year
600 * 8.9 = 5.3 tonnes CO2/year

2.5 Mt / coal plant

470k cars = 1 coal plant

### Challenges
How much is ethical and responsible action a market demand driver?
How does the market drive credit supply?
How are CDR instruments verified and maintained?
Can purchases be transferred to compliance markets?
